# Stock-Terminal-App
This sample code launches a Streamlit app that fetches real-time stock data from TD Ameritrade's API. An access code and account number are required to gain access. For privacy reasons, only the main.cpp file is posted.
I learned how to fetch data from an API as well as the importance of protecting sensitive data. Additionally, I gained an insight and interest to the workings of algorithmic trading.
